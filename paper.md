## Abstract

Diveboard (http://www.diveboard.com) is an online scuba diving platform, where divers can digitize or log their dives including the observed species, participate in citizen science surveys and projects, and interact with others. More than 10,000 divers have already registered with Diveboard and the community is still growing. This dataset contains all observations made by Diveboarders worldwide and the species in this dataset are linked to the Encyclopedia of Life (www.eol.org) as a taxonomical backbone. The dataset contains mainly fish observations (Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii) (73%) but also holds occurrences of numerous other groups. Every record in the dataset links back to the digital dive log, creating the opportunity to trace back to the original observation and dive, through the Diveboard website. For many dives pictures are provided in the digital logbook, but momentarily they are not directly linked with the occurrence data. To date the dataset contains around 16 000 occurrences provided by 800 divers, recorded on 2500 different localities in 106 different countries. The number of participating divers is growing every day and the amount of data which could be generated through Diveboard is virtually unlimited. The “Diveboard; Citizen science” dataset is automatically published every month through and is available through: http://ipt.diveboard.com/resource.do?r=diveboard-occurrences
Issues with the data or the dataset can be submitted through github: https://github.com/Datafable/diveboard-data-paper

**Keywords**: occurrence, observation, citizen science, marine, freshwater, fishes, scuba diving, reef, shark

**Purpose**: The Diveboard dataset is being created by the desire of the amateur diver community to help the scientific community in research towards protecting the biodiversity of our oceans, seas, and freshwater bodies. The data is not generated with any overarching purpose, other than completing one’s personal digital log of dives. The Diveboard community has dedicated the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver, so these can be used as widely as possible. It needs to be mentioned that this dataset originated from citizen science observations and no direct validation by experts was performed. The Diveboard team and Datafable are continuously working on ways to improve the quality and fitness for use of the data. Just like the Diveboard website, the diveboard dataset is a continious work in progress and we predict major quality improvement and better identifications in the data. A featured feature on the website is that species can be identified by amatuers or specialists based on the pictures taken during a certain dive.

## Taxonomic coverage

**General taxonomic coverage description**: The dataset covers animals (and very few plants) observed during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. To date 2013-11-28, about 73 % of the recorded specimens are fishes from the classes Elasmobranchii (12%) and  Actinopterygii (72%) other well represented classes are the Malacostraca (5%), Reptilia (5%) (mostly Testudines) and Cephalopoda (3%). Overall, 29 different classes, according to Encyclopedia of life are so far recorded in the database.  For about 490 occurrences, no higher taxonomy was deducted from the Encyclopedia of life.

Diveboarders can log their dives online, including the species they observed, by using the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org) as a checklist. Most of the observations are identified to species level (to date about 14.700), though some caution regarding the identifications is appropriate. In case of doubt, the observer/identifier can be contacted via the references field, which references his/her Diveboard profile or through this Github link: https://github.com/Datafable/diveboard-data-paper

## Spatial coverage

**General spatial coverage**: The Diveboard Scuba diving citizen science observations dataset is a global dataset. This means that observations can “virtually” be made everywhere on the planet. Off course, divers do mostly explore more or less fixed dive spots. When logging a dive on diveboard, divers do always have the opportunity to create a new “locality or dive site”, by naming it and placing a pin on the map. The person who logs the dive, is also asked to give the country (Dwc: country); the location (nearest administrative area); the sea/lake name (DwC:WaterBody) and the longitude (decimalLongitude) and latitude (decimalLatitude). More likely, a diver can log a dive to an already know dive site in the Diveboard database. In the dataset we can find, to date, data originating from 106 countries. Logically, and representesd in the data are top diving countries like Australia (Great barrier reef; almost 3000 occurrences, United states (mainly Pacific ocean; almost 2000 occurrences) and Egypt (Red sea; almost 1200 occurrences).

**Coordinates**: 90°0'0''S and 90°0'0''N Latitude; 180°0'0''W and 180°0'0''E Longitude

**Living time period**: 1980-recent

## Methods

**Method step description**: Event and location conditions (date, time, depth, etc.) are often logged automatically by the dive computer. This data can be imported or manually added by the diver in the Diveboard application, while observed species are added manually. These actions can be done just after surfacing, as the Diveboard application is available online and as a mobile app, which allows divers to record their dive even if no internet connection is available.

**Study extent description**: The dataset covers recorded observations made during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. As such there is no specific geographic or temporal study extent, although most dives logged on Diveboard were conducted in well-known dive spots, such as well-known reefs and wrecks. In a later phase, specific surveys might also be logged on Diveboard.

**Sampling description**: Observations are not recorded with a specific goal in mind and only reflect what the diver has noticed during the dive. Divers rarely conduct a full inventory of a dive spot, so the observed species only represent part of the occurring species at the time of the dive. There is a sampling bias for known, interesting, noticeable and/or rare species.

**Quality control description**: The Diveboard application restricts divers to only record species found in the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org). As such, all observations are linked to an EOL page in the field taxonID. It is important to note that the data are not validated by specialists.

## Datasets

## Dataset history

Since 2011, Diveboard lets scuba divers track and share their scuba diving experiences by providing them with a multimedia online logbook. The logbook can connect directly with dive computers through a PC/MAC plugin and fetch dive profiles. Divers can complete their logbook by adding observed species for every performed dive. Since October 2013, this online logbook is connected with GBIF, hoping that the publication of the data will help more scuba divers to get involved in monitoring our biotope in real time and in providing valuable data to scientists including species occurrences and dive profiles. Not only recent succeeded dives can be logged on Diveboard, also older dives, including occurrences, logged in the original divers log booklet can be digitized in the same way. This means that Diveboard is not only generating new data, but also historical data is mobilized this way.

## Featured data use

The data generated through Diveboard has a high potential in the monitoring of reef biodiversity. Unfortunately data generated by divers is biased. Divers usually only note the most interesting observed species and species are not always completely determined. For this dataset 87% of the occurrences are brought to species level. In the dataset there is a large percentage of Actinopterygii (70%) and Elasmobranchii (10%) recorded, simply because divers usually look for the “big” fish or everything out of the ordinary. On the other hand, the data is very valuable and can potentially work as an early warning system for invasive species. The invasion of the Lionfish (Pterois sp.) in the seas near Central America is well illustrated through in the data. 

## Dataset description 

The Diveboard Darwin Core Archive is generated by creating a custom SQL query on the original Diveboard MySQL database. The SQL query generates a particular view on the data which is compliant with the Darwin Core standard. In IPT, a simple SQL statement makes the view ready for publication. After validation of the mapping the Darwin Core Archive is created and published to GBIF. More information on this process can be found at: https://github.com/Datafable/diveboard-gbif. The Darwin Core terms published in this dataset are:
